**GOAL**:  An open-source device that can monitor 6 key environmental factors that affect people's perception of a healthy and productive workspace:

- Temperature
- Pressure
- eCO2
- Humidity
- Brightness
- Noise
- TVOC
- PM 2.5um

Measure 8+ variables that affect the environmental quality of a room.... temp, humidity, atmospheric pressure, lux, eCO2, VOC, particulate matter, sound/noise level. Pack it up and send it to a website for remote monitoring. Wanted something a bit more rugged than a breadboard as I start testing it. Next phase is learning from real world environment and lots of code cleanup... 'clooged' together a lot of example code, now I want to write something more usable and maintainable.
